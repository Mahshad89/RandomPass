## WHAT YOU NEED FOR CLEAN CODE

## Error Handling:
The code includes error handling in the `main()`, including catching `ValueError` and then printing meaningful error messages to the user. So the user could find what error exactly happened.

## User Interaction:
The user interaction is handled in the main function, making it clear how the script interacts with the user.
Simplify boolean expressions for better readability. For example, instead of `strip().lower() == 'y'`, consider using `strip().lower() in ('y', 'yes')`.

## Consistent Naming:
Descriptive and consistent naming not only makes it easier to read your code but also means that everyone can easily understand what your code means. In addition, make your code more maintainable for yourself by aiding in understanding the purpose of each variable, function, and ...
On the other hand, Some strings that are used multiple times in your code could be defined as constants for better maintainability (e.g., "passwords.txt" in my code).

## Reducing the amount of code:
The code in `check_password_strength` has some complexities and could be simplified. It is replaced by readable and less confusing code.
