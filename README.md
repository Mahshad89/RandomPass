# Random Password Generator 

## Overview 
 The Random Password Generator is a simple Python script that generates secure and random passwords and passphrases. It can be used to create strong and unique passwords and passphrases for various online accounts and enhance your digital security. 
 This project was inspired by the need for stronger and more secure passwords in today's digital world. It is a simple and effective way to enhance your overall online security posture. In summary, strong passwords act as a crucial barrier to protecting your personal and financial information, preventing identity theft, and maintaining your privacy in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

 ## Requirements Engineering
For managing software requirements for my project, I used `notion.so` as a self-made tool and `JIRA` as a professional tool.

From this link, https://ludicrous-hydrant-b02.notion.site/Random-Password-Generator-RPG-e0f37a34e2a74e27bb3fd445d6d7f9a3?pvs=4  you can see my published website by `notion`.

From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/REQUIREMENTSENG/RequirementsEngineeringByNotion.pdf you can find the PDF version which is exported from `notion`.

From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/REQUIREMENTSENG/Requirements%20EngineeringByJIRA.pdf you can see visually my RPG project as a software requirements project by `JIRA`.


 ## Analysis
From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/ANALYSIS/ProjectChecklist.pdf you can find my checklist with the points that I consider relevant to my project. 

From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/ANALYSIS/ProjectAnalysis.pdf you can find my project analysis as a start-up idea.


 ## DDD
 Do a DDD session to find your domains. From this link, you can see DDD charts.
 
 A) From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/DDD/EventStorming.png you can see visual event storming.
 
 B) From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/DDD/CoreDomainChart.png you can see the core domain chart. 
 
 C) From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/DDD/DomainRelations.png  you can see relations between the domains.
 

 ## Metrics
 Using Sonarcube.

 Maintainability, Reliability, Security, Duplications, Number of bugs, Number of code smells, and number of vulnerabilities are shown.

 From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/METRICS/METRICS.pdf you can see the results.
 

 ## Clean Code Development
 CCD principles could include Error handling, variable naming, user interaction, function decomposition, better commenting, and documentation. trying to code would be functional, but applying some clean coding principles could make it even more understandable and robust.

 From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/CCD/CCD.md you can see why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved.

 From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/CCD/CleanCodeDevelopment.pdf you can see the pdf version of CCD in my project.

 From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/CCD/CleanCodeCheatSheet.pdf you can see the cheatsheet for Clean Code Development.
 

 ## Build Management
For my build management, I have chosen `setuptools`, which is a common tool for packaging and distributing Python projects. It includes facilities for managing dependencies, versioning, and creating distribution packages.
From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/BUILD/BUILD.md you can see how I install and use `setuptools` for my project.


 ## UnitTests
 I've created test cases for each of the functions in the script using the `unit test` framework. The tests cover various scenarios, including default cases, custom configurations, and error handling.
 From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/UnitTests/UnitTest.pdf you can see the results of running 6 unit tests in my code.

 To integrate my unit tests into the build process, I use a CI tool to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying my code. One popular CI service is `GitHub Actions`, which is tightly integrated with `GitHub Repositories.

 From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/UnitTests/GitHubActions.pdf you can see which steps I took to integrate unit tests using `GitHub Actions`.

 
 ## Choosing IDE
 Choose one IDE that best aligns with your project requirements, as well as your preferences, and needs. I use Visual Studio Code (VSCode), which is the best lightweight text editor for me since it has lots of useable Python extensions.

 Here are the lists of key shortcuts that I usually use:
  `Ctrl + /`          Comment or uncomment selected lines.
  `Ctrl + Space`      Code completion.
  `F5`                Start Debugging.
  `Ctrl + Shift + P`  open command palette.
  `Ctrl + D`          Select the next occurrence
  

  ## Functional Programming
   To prove that I have covered all functional aspects of my code which is listed below, you can see this link https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/FUNCTIONALPROGRAMMING/FunctionalProgramming.pdf.
   
   1. Only final data structures.
   
   2. Side-effect-free functions.
   
   3. The use of higher-order functions.
   
   4. Functions as parameters and return values.
      
   6. Use closures / anonymous functions
