# Random Password Generator 

## Overview 
 The Random Password Generator is a simple Python script that generates secure and random passwords and passphrases. It can be used to create strong and unique passwords and passphrases for various online accounts and enhance your digital security. 
 This project was inspired by the need for stronger and more secure passwords in today's digital world. It is a simple and effective way to enhance your overall online security posture. In summary, strong passwords act as a crucial barrier to protecting your personal and financial information, preventing identity theft, and maintaining your privacy in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

## Features 
Generates random passwords with customizable length. 
Includes a variety of character types, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. 
Easily configurable to meet your specific password requirements. 
Provides the option to save generated passwords to a text file for future reference.

## Getting Started 
Clone or download the repository to your local machine. 
Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3). 
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. 
Run the script by executing the following command:``` python password_generator.py ```

 ## Configuration 
 You can customize the password generation by modifying the `password_generator.py` script. The following parameters can be adjusted:
 `password_length`: Set the desired length of the generated password.
 `use_uppercase`, `use_lowercase`, `use_digits`, and `use_special_chars`: Toggle these variables to include or exclude character types in the generated password. 
 Saving Passwords: You can choose to save generated passwords to a text file for easy access. Simply provide a filename when prompted, and your passwords will be 
 stored for future reference. 

 ## Example Usage 
 1. Run the script using `python password_generator.py`. 
 2. Choose your desired password length and character types. 
 3. Save the generated password to a file if needed.

 ## Clean Code Development
 CCD principles could include Error handling, variable naming, user interaction, function decomposition, better commenting, and documentation. trying to code would be functional, but applying some clean coding principles could make it even more understandable and robust.

 From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/CCD/CCD.md you can see why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved.

 ## Build
For my build management, I have chosen `setuptools`, which is a common tool for packaging and distributing Python projects. It includes facilities for managing dependencies, versioning, and creating distribution packages.
From this link, https://github.com/Mahshad89/RandomPass/blob/main/BUILD/BUILD.md you can see how I install and use `setuptools` for my project.

 ## UnitTests

 ## Choosing IDE
 Choose one IDE that best aligns with your project requirements, as well as your preferences, and needs. I use Visual Studio Code (VSCode), which is the best lightweight text editor for me since it has lots of useable Python extensions.

 Here are the lists of key shortcuts that I usually use:
  `Ctrl + /`          Comment or uncomment selected lines.
  `Ctrl + Space`      Code completion.
  `F5`                Start Debugging.
  `Ctrl + Shift + P`  open command palette.
  `Ctrl + D`          Select the next occurrence
